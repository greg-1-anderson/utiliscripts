# USAGE:
#
#	snapshot2 user@target.tld [GATEWAYIP INTERFACE]
#
#		OR
#
#	snapshot2 target.tld
#
#		OR in cron:
#
#	0 */4 * * * /bin/snapshot2 --ssh-identity /root/.ssh/id_rsa --require-network 172.30.10.1 eth0 --user ga --backup "bin,Documents,work" greg@ftp.adc.rsv.ricoh.com:/home2/greg/archives/ga-laptop >>/var/log/snapshot.log 2>&1
#
#	Runs every four hours; change the "4" to a "1" to run every hour.
#
# FLAGS:
#
#	--backup BACKUP_ITEM_LIST
#
#	Specify the list of local folders to back up.  There are two
#	formatting options; PICK ONE:
#
#		folder1,folder2,folder3		List of folders in /home/$localUser
#
#		/home/user/folder /etc/profile.d /srv/www
#
#	In other words, you can have either a comma-separated list of
#	folders in the user's home directory, or a space-separated list
#	of full paths.  Leading slashes are IGNORED in comma-separated
#	lists; you'll get /home/$USER//path, which will still be relative
#	to the user's home directory.
#
#	--user USERNAME
#
#	Use this flag to specify that the local user should  be something
#	other than $USER.  Useful when running as root from cron.
#
#	Note that the user is only relevant if using the comma-separated
#	backup target list shorthand (see below) or if there is no "user@"
#	in the backup target.  If these notations are avoided, then the
#	user is irrelevant.
#
#	--ssh-identity IDENTITY_FILE
#
#	Specifies where to find the identity file.  You must specify your
#	identity file if its name does not begin with "id" or if you have
#	more than one private key or if your identity files are not stored
#	in /home/$USER/.ssh (e.g. when running as root).
#
#	--ssh-key-ok
#
#	This flag indicates that it is okay to run this script without first
#	invoking ssh-agent.  In general, it is not necessary to use this flag
#	directly, as this script will detect if you have already used ssh-add
#	on your key, and this flag is not necessary in other situations.
#
#	--require-network GATEWAY_IP INTERFACE
#
#	If the optional --require-network option is
#	specified, then the script will do nothing unless
#	"route -n" reports that the gateway for the specified
#	interface exists.  For example, if you specify:
#
#		--require-network 10.100.1.1 eth0
#
#	then this script will exit unless your laptop is connected
#	to a network whose gateway is 10.100.1.1 on eth0.
#
#	--rsync-flags flag1 flag2 flag3 ;
#
#	Specifies additional options to pass to rsync, terminated by a ";".  
#	These can have various different effects.  For example, if you have
#	one machine backing up to greg@ftp.adc.rsv.ricoh.com:/home2/greg/archives/ga-laptop,
#	and another backing up to greg@ftp.adc.rsv.ricoh.com:/home2/greg/archives/ga-desktop,
#	and the same files exist on both machines, then you might want to 
#	add --rsync-flags --link-dest=/home2/greg/archives/ga-desktop ; to the 
#	laptop, and --rsync-flags --link-dest=/home2/greg/archives/ga-laptop ;
#	to the desktop so that the files common to both machines are stored
#	only once in the backup.  This parameter can also be used to
#	override the default 
#
# SSH KEY SETUP:
#
#	Create id_dsa and id_dsa.pub on the client
#	machine, and copy id_dsa.pub into authorized_keys
#	on the target.
#
#	Follow the instructions at:
#
#		http://kimmo.suominen.com/docs/ssh/
#
#	For example:
#
#		sudo bash
#		cd /root
#		ssh-keygen -t rsa
#		ls -al .ssh
#		scp .ssh/id_rsa.pub USER@domain.com:/home/USER/.ssh/my_id_rsa.pub
#		ssh USER@domain.com
#		cd .ssh
#		cat my_id_rsa.pub
#		cat my_id_rsa.pub >> authorized_keys
#		chmod 600 authorized_keys
#
#	If this program will run in cron as root, then 
#	your id_dsa and id_dsa.pub should be in /root/.ssh,
#	and the key should not be protected with a password.
#	In general, identity files should always be password-protected;
#	however, if the identity file is only readable by root,
#	and if it is only used to access a remote user account
#	that is only used to store backup files, then a passwordless
#	identity file is reasonable.
#
# CRON SETUP:
#
#	It is presumed that you will want to run this script
#	as root; running as root insures that the existance of
#	files that you cannot read without su permissions
#	in your home directory should not interfere with your
#	backup process.  If you never become root (e.g if 
#	you are unable to log in as root), then you may run
#	this script without su priveledges.
#
#	Cron is configured with the crontab command, which is
#	stateless.  To change the settings of the cron table,
#	you must replace the whole table.  So, the first step
#	is to determine what is currently in the crontab
#	like so:
#
#		$ sudo crontab -l > tmp.crontab
#		$ cat tmp.crontab
#
#		0 */1 * * * /bin/cron-snapshot2 --ssh-identity /root/.ssh/id_rsa --require-network 10.100.1.1 eth0 --user ga --backup "bin,Documents,work" reetstreet.com >>/var/log/snapshot.log 2>&1
#		57 */1 * * * /bin/cron-snapshot2 --ssh-identity /root/.ssh/id_rsa --require-network 172.30.10.1 eth0 --user ga --backup "bin,Documents,work" greg@ftp.ricohsv.com:/home2/greg/archives/ga-laptop >>/var/log/snapshot.log 2>&1
#
#	Next, edit tmp.crontab, and then load it:
#
#		$ sudo crontab tmp.crontab
#
#	DO NOT FORGET to copy snapshot2 and migratehistories to
#	/bin/cron-snapshot2 and /bin/cron-migratehistories.
#
#	That's it.
#
# STRUCTURE:
#
#	This program makes historic backup snapshots of
#	directories in your home folder.  The technique is
#	similar to rolling backup scripts, but historic
#	backups are stored chronologically.
#
#	All backups are stored in the following location:
#
#		target:/home/USER/archives/localMachine
#
#	Inside this directory, the structure is as follows:
#
#		current			The most recent snapshot
#		previous		The snapshot that came before
#		history			Chronological snapshots older than most recent two
#			hourly
#			daily
#			weekly
#			monthly
#			yearly
#
# CREDITS:
#
#	The concepts in this script are based on work
#	referenced on this page:
#
#		http://www.mikerubel.org/computers/rsync_snapshots/
#
#	The main improvements of this script are chronological
#	historic backups, "push" backups done to a remote
#	machine without using a custom service on the target,
#	and the ability to supress backup operations when on an
#	alien network.
#
# TODO:
#
#	Some things to consider...
#
#	    *	With backups being taken at arbitrary intervals
#		as work is done, it is not necessarily the case
#		that the snapshots choosen for long-term archival
#		will necessarily be the "best" ones.  Perhaps at
#		the rate work progresses, this is not necessary;
#		however, it might be nice to suppliment the cron
#		backup task with manual 'daily' and 'monthly' scripts
#		that take a local backup and mirror it to history/daily
#		or history/monthly as appropriate.
