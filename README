Utiliscripts
============

Utiliscripts make your life easier.  Hopefully, each script will be
self-documenting if you read the source, but maybe not.

Someday I will put a master index here.  Maybe.

One of the things I use these scripts for is to make all of my systems
behave uniformly.  To whit:

	sudo apt-get install git
        wget https://raw.github.com/greg-1-anderson/utiliscripts/master/move-in
	chmod +x move-in
        ./move-in
        
        # Optional:
        rm move-in
        source .bashrc

The move-in script checks out all of the utiliscripts and sets
up the $PATH and a number of other environment settings.
