Utiliscripts
============

Utiliscripts make your life easier.  Hopefully, each script will be
self-documenting if you read the source, but maybe not.

Someday I will put a master index here.  Maybe.

One of the things I use these scripts for is to make all of my systems
behave uniformly.  To whit:

	# First:

	sudo apt-get install git php5 php5-json wmctrl curl
  git config --global user.email "..."
  git config --global user.name "..."
  wget https://raw.github.com/greg-1-anderson/utiliscripts/master/move-in
	chmod +x move-in
  ./move-in

  # Optional:

  rm move-in
  source $HOME/.bashrc
  sudo $HOME/local/utiliscripts/install-components

The move-in script checks out all of the utiliscripts and sets
up the $PATH and a number of other environment settings.

The install-components uses `apt-get install` to install a whole
bunch of packages.  Run with --help to see options for installing
less than everything (the default is 'everything').

Note:  Some of these scripts (e.g. move-in) work fine on the Mac.
Use the `brew-install` script instead of `install-components` to get
the software you need.
